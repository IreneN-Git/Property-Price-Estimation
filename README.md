# Property-Price-Estimation
**Objective**: Develop predictive models to analyse and estimate property prices in 3 cities in Ireland Dublin, Cork and Limerick
**Approach**:
- Implemented Random Forest, Multiple Linear Regression, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to predict property prices for the 3 locations.
- Performed EDA and extensive feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Conducted model evaluation, with the GAM emerging as the best-performing model.
- Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify key features most sought after by customers during property searches.

**Results**:
- Predicted property prices with high accuracy based on the identified key features which was informative for real estate business.
- The GAM model outperformed other models in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.

**Technologies Used**: R, caret, mgcv, tidyverse, tm (NLP package).
